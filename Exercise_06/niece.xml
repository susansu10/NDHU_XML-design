      There comes a time
   </feature>
   <feature>
      When we heed a certain call
   </feature>
   <feature>
      When the world must come together as one
   </feature>
   <feature>
      There are people dying
   </feature>
   <feature>
      Oh, and it's time to lend a hand to life
   </feature>
   <feature>
      The greatest gift of all
   </feature>
   <feature>
      
   </feature>
   <feature>
      We can't go on
   </feature>
   <feature>
      Pretending day-by-day
   </feature>
   <feature>
      That someone, somewhere soon make a change
   </feature>
   <feature>
      We're all a part of God's great big family
   </feature>
   <feature>
      And the truth, you know, love is all we need
   </feature>
   <feature>
      
   </feature>
   <feature>
      We are the world
   </feature>
   <feature>
      We are the children
   </feature>
   <feature>
      We are the ones who make a brighter day, so let's start giving
   </feature>
   <feature>
      There's a choice we're making
   </feature>
   <feature>
      We're saving our own lives
   </feature>
   <feature>
      It's true we'll make a better day, just you and me
   </feature>
   <feature>
      
   </feature>
   <feature>
      Oh, send them your heart
   </feature>
   <feature>
      So they know that someone cares
   </feature>
   <feature>
      And their lives will be stronger and free
   </feature>
   <feature>
      As God has shown us by turning stones to bread
   </feature>
   <feature>
      And so we all must lend a helping hand
   </feature>
   <feature>
      
   </feature>
   <feature>
      We are the world
   </feature>
   <feature>
      We are the children
   </feature>
   <feature>
      We are the ones who make a brighter day, so let's start giving
   </feature>
   <feature>
      Oh, there's a choice we're making
   </feature>
   <feature>
      We're saving our own lives
   </feature>
   <feature>
      It's true we'll make a better day, just you and me
   </feature>
   <feature>
      
   </feature>
   <feature>
      When you're down and out, there seems no hope at all
   </feature>
   <feature>
      But if you just believe there's no way we can fall
   </feature>
   <feature>
      Well, well, well, well let us realize
   </feature>
   <feature>
      Oh, that a change can only come
   </feature>
   <feature>
      When we stand together as one, yeah, yeah, yeah
   </feature>
   <feature>
      
   </feature>
   <feature>
      We are the world
   </feature>
   <feature>
      We are the children
   </feature>
   <feature>
      We are the ones who make a brighter day, so let's start giving
   </feature>
   <feature>
      Oh, there's a choice we're making
   </feature>
   <feature>
      We're saving our own lives
   </feature>
   <feature>
      It's true we'll make a better day, just you and me
